		' This iLogic rule by Luke Davenport @ Excitech.
		' The rule selects all the TOP LEVEL bolted connections in the active assembly, turns on the standard 'Auto Solve'
		' ....option, and then updates the assembly. Once the bolted connections have updated, the 'Auto Solve' option is 
		' ....then switched off so assembly performance is not affected.
		
		' Important note: this code will only recognise bolted connections that have a name containing 'Bolt'. Please customize
		' ....this to suit.
