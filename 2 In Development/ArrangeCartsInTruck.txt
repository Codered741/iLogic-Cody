' iLogic script to arrange cart assemblies within a truck's rectangular sketch on XY plane
' Assumptions: Truck part named contains "truck" (case-insensitive) with a sketch containing a single rectangle
' Carts are placed on XY plane with Z=0, no rotation, sorted by browser tree order
' Uses corner-based positions with 6-inch step size, retries up to 3 times without shuffling if a cart cannot be placed, all in inches
